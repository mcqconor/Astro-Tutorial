    <h2>This is where I will digitally scream my thoughts out into the world</h2>

    <p>I kinda think this is more fun than using substack, but they're for very different purposes</p>

    <p>Alternatively, I could do literally anything else</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/posts/post-1/">Post 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="/posts/post-2/">Post 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="/posts/post-3/">Post 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</BaseLayout>
